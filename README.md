# cpp

This projects serve as the introduction to c++ and object oriented programming.

## Concepts

- objects and classes
- orthodox canonical form
  - constructor
  - copy constructor
  - copy assignment operator
  - destructor
- fixed vs floating point numbers
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- deep copy vs shallow copy
- abstract classes/interfases
- type conversions
- templates
- exceptions
- containers, algorithms and iterators

## Technologies Used

- `C++`, `Makefile`

## What I learned

- there is many more ways of doing on thing in `c++` than in `c`
- to look for existing functions and solutions for a problem
  - durng our studes in `c` we have been very limited to the external functions we are allowed to use, in `c++` there is almost no such limitations for us. It has been somewhat difficult to change the way of looking at a problem because of this.
- object oriented coding
